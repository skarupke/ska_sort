# Introduction

`ska_sort` is an in-place radix sort, implemented as a C++14 header-only library using templates.

# Usage

For a vector of a basic type, just pass two iterators:

```C++
ska_sort(durations.begin(), durations.end());
```

For a more complicated situation, provide a lambda that returns a key
to sort on:

```C++
ska_sort(enemies.begin(), enemies.end(), [](const Enemey & enemy)
{
    return std::make_tuple(!is_in_combat(enemy), distance_to_player(enemy));
});
```
